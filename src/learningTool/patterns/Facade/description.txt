The Facade defines a unified, higher-level interface to a subsystem that makes it easier to use. For this example imagine a consumer ordering from a catalog. The consumer calls one number and speaks with a customer service representative. The customer service representative acts as a Facade, providing an interface to the order fulfillment department, the billing department and the shipping department

Facade defines a new interface, whereas Adapter reuses an old interface. So, the Adapter Pattern makes two existing interface work together as opposed to defining an entirely new one. Adapter and Facade are both wrappers, but they are different types. The intent of a Facade is to produce a simpler interface, and the intent of an Adapter is to design to an existing interface.
