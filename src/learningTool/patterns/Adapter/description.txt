The Adapter Pattern allows otherwise incompatible classes to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients. Imagine socket wrenches for this example. A socket attaches to a ratchet, provided that the size of the drive is the same. Letâ€™s assume that the drive sizes are 10mm and 5mm. Obviously, a 10mm drive will not fit into a 5mm drive socket unless an adapter is used. So, a 10mm to a 5mm adapter has a 10mm connection that fits on the 10mm drive, and a 5mm opposite connection that fits in the 5mm socket.
